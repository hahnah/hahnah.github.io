## Writing a blog post

Add a new markdown file in `content/tech-blog/<any slug what to want>.md` or `content/life-blog/<any slug what to want>.md`.  
Palce images for posts in public/images/tech-blog/<slug>/ or public/images/life-blog/<slug>/ directory.

## Deploying on GitHub Pages

1. Make sure your repositgory name is same as `<your github username>.github.io`. If not, change it.
2. Edit `Settings.domain` definition in `src/Settings.elm` file. It shoulbe be `<your github username>.github.io`.
3. Make sure `Settings.basePath` is `"/"` in `src/Settings.elm` file.
4. Setup GitHub Pages on GitHub site at "Settings" tab -> "Pages":
   - Set "Source" to `Deploy from a branch`
   - Set "Branch" to `gh-pages` branch and `/root` directory.

Deployment Settings are done!  
Every time you push to the `main` branch, the site will be built and deployed to GitHub Pages with this URL: `https://<your github username>.github.io`.

### Can we deploy site to subdirectory in GitHub Pages?

Which mean, like `https://<your github username>.github.io/any-subdirectory`.  
Typically, subdirectory name will be same as repository name.

The answer is... **No, we can't**.

It's because of elm-pages bug of `build --base ...` command.  
See below issue for more details.
