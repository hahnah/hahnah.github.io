We often capture meaningful moments as photos.  
We frame them, hang them on walls, or carefully place them into albums.

Videos, however, tend to be different.  
After recording, they usually become something we simply watch—often on a small screen, and often only once or twice.

But what if videos could be kept the same way as photos?  
What if they could be connected to a specific place, bringing back not only the image, but also the atmosphere and movement of that moment?

That question became the starting point for **MemoriaR**.

## Why MemoriaR Was Created

Photos have always had a special role in how we remember.  
They live in physical space—on walls, desks, and shelves—and quietly remind us of moments that matter.

Videos, despite holding even richer memories, are usually stored as files.  
They stay inside our devices, separated from the places where they were recorded.

MemoriaR was created to bridge that gap.

Instead of treating videos as data to be stored, MemoriaR aims to preserve them as **memories tied to real-world spaces**.

By connecting videos to physical photos, memories become something you can return to—right where they belong.

## A New Way to Experience Memories

MemoriaR is an iPhone and iPad app that lets you enjoy videos in a completely new way.

Rather than watching videos only on a screen, you can place your memories into your everyday surroundings and experience them again at any time.

With MemoriaR, moments are not just saved.  
They are revisited—naturally and intuitively.

## When Photos Come to Life

At the heart of MemoriaR is a simple idea:  
**printed photos become keys to your videos.**

Point your iPhone or iPad at a photo, and the related video plays in AR at that exact location.  
The moment appears to come back to life, blending gently with the real world around you.

There’s no complicated setup and no technical knowledge required.  
Just point your device and watch the memory unfold.

## Made for Everyday Moments

MemoriaR isn’t only for special occasions.  
It’s designed for all kinds of memories, including:

- Trips and travels
- Family moments
- Personal milestones
- Ordinary days you don’t want to forget

By combining photos and videos, MemoriaR helps preserve not just how a moment looked, but how it felt to be there.

## What You Can Do with MemoriaR

### Watch Videos in AR

Point your device at a printed photo to see the related video play in the same place.  
Memories feel more vivid when they exist in the real world.

### Print Your Memories

Videos can be turned into photos for printing.  
Hang them on your wall, place them on a desk, or store them in albums—just like traditional photos.

### Record Videos Your Way

Record videos directly within the app.  
Vertical, horizontal, and square formats are supported, and selfie recording is available.

### Import Existing Videos

Already have videos on your device?  
You can import them into MemoriaR and turn them into AR memories.

### Organize by Album

Group your memories into albums for easy access and organization.  
With a premium subscription, you can create an unlimited number of albums.

### Sync Across Devices

Albums can be shared automatically across your iPhone and iPad using the same Apple Account.  
Your memories stay with you, wherever you are.

## Keeping Memories Close

MemoriaR is not about replacing photos or videos.  
It’s about bringing them together in a way that feels more human and more lasting.

By tying videos to physical space, MemoriaR helps keep your memories close—not just on your phone, but in your everyday life.

## Get Started with MemoriaR

If you’ve ever wished your videos could feel as tangible and meaningful as photos, MemoriaR offers a simple, thoughtful way to make that possible.
