## Take videos with unique shape!

Normal ways of taking videos are available only with a specific shape, aren't they?  
That sounds boring ʕº̫͡ºʔ

With "Flex Camera" app, you can take any rectangular videos, e.g., square video, narrow rectangular video, or full size video.

Also available with selfies, of cource.

Let's enjoy unique videos with Flex Camera! ʕ•̀ω•́ʔ✧
