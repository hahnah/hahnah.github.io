## Why I Created AR Photoplay

We usualy take photos of memorial scenes and decorate them in a room, or stick in an photo album.  
But unfortunately, we can't do like that with VIDEOS.

If videos could be decorated as same as photos, memories will always be remembered clearly.

I created AR Photoplay to realize that.  
AR Photoplay saves memorial scenes of your life as special photos, which play videos.

You need an printer to print photos for AR Photoplay.  
I recommend you **AirPrint compatible printers**. Most of recent models are AirPrint compatible.

Even if your printer is not compatible with AirPrint, you may print throuth your PC.

For your information, I use Canon's **SELPHY CP1300**.  
That's an compact printer for photograph printing, of cource AirPrint compatible.
